This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function. The issue is that the function may not be called when a barcode is scanned. This is due to the `Camera` component's internal state not being updated correctly. The solution involves using the `useRef` hook to store the `onBarCodeScanned` function and updating its value when the function changes.
